# GAP-Solver
A simple college project, where General assignment problem (GAP) is solved.
As a small twist clients and servers have their weighs, but the core problem stays the same.
The problem is solved using constraint modeling language (MiniZinc) and exact algorithms.
The problem is also solved using Matlab and genetic algorithm.
